## Research focus / PhD project
  
  My research focuses on addressing inefficiencies in supply chain management for contraceptive products in developing countries. These inefficiencies often lead to shortages, limiting women's reproductive autonomy and exacerbating societal challenges. By integrating probabilistic forecasting with inventory optimization, I aim to create a novel approach that accounts for uncertainties, poor data quality, and local demand variations. This interdisciplinary project involves collaboration with scholars from Cardiff Business School, the School of Computer Science & Informatics, and the United States Agency for International Development (USAID). The goal is to improve access to contraceptives, reduce unintended pregnancies, and prevent unsafe abortions, ultimately benefiting women, healthcare providers, governments, and donor organizations.

By utilizing data analytics, forecasting, machine learning, deep learning, probabilistic modelling, computer vision, and natural language processing, this PhD study will explore how climate change risks, particularly rising sea levels and increased flooding, will shape the future delivery of health and care services. 
This research is supported by four partners: Public Health Wales, the Future Generations Commissioner for Wales, Natural Resources Wales, and the Office for National Statistics.
